Notes made on making the game 'Alien Invasion'

In Python, 'self' is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used inside class methods to access the instanceâ€™s attributes and other methods. When you write 'self.attribute' or 'self.method()', you are referring to the data and functions that belong to that specific object.
'self' is given as the first parameter in every instance method of a class, but do not have to include while calling the method.
* You start out writing your code as simply as possible, and then refactor it as your project beomes more complex.

Terms:
1. Object: It is a collection of data (attributes) and functions (methods) that are bundled together. They are created from classes, which are like blueprints for what the object should be and do.
2. Game elements: Specific objects in the game, like an alien or a ship.
3. Surface: A part of the screen where a game element can be displayed. Each element in the game is its own surface.
4. Event: An action that the user performs while playing the game, such as pressing a key or moving the mouse.
5. Event loop: A loop written to listen for events and perform appropriate tasks depending on the kinds of events that occur.
6. Rect object: A special object that represents a rectangle. It store information about the rectangle's position (x and y coordinates) and its size (width and height).
7. Helper method: A function defined inside a class that performs a specific, often small or repetitive tast to support other methods in the class. They work inside a cleass but isn't meant to be used by code outside the class. In Python, a single leading underscore indicaes a helper method.


Code/Methods:
1. pygame.init() -> initializes the background settings that Pygame needs to work properly.
2. pygame.display.set_mode((<pixels by width>, <pixels by height>)) -> creates a display window on which we draw all the game's graphical elements, while defining the dimensions of the game window in pixels width by height.
3. pygame.display.set_caption("<Title>") -> sets the title of the display window.
4. pygame.event.get() -> returns a list of events that have taken place since the last time it was called - to access the events that Pygame detects.
5. pygame.QUIT -> event where the player clicks the game window's close button.
6. pygame.display.flip() -> tells pygame to make the most recently drawn screen visible.
7. pygame.time.Clock() -> creates an instance of 'Clock' class from the 'pygame.time' module. The object keeps track of how much time has passed between each frame. Also measures time and helps manage the speed of the game.
8. self.clock.tick(<integer for the fps>) -> the tick() method controls how many times the loop runs per second.
9. self.get_rect() -> used to obtain a Rect object that represents the size (width and height) and position (x and y coordinates) of a surface (screen or image). This Rect makes it easy to position, move, and align objects.
10. pygame.image.load('<image address>') -> used to load an image. It returns a surface representing the image.
11. self.rect -> Rectangle that defines the position and size of the image.
12. self.rect.<position> -> is not a new variable, its a built in attribute of the Pygame Rect object.
13. self.rect.<position> = self.screen.get_rect().<position> -> assigns the position and coordinates of midbottom of the screen to the midbottom of the image.
14. self.screen.blit(<image>, <rect>) -> draws the image onto the screen at the position specified by rect.


Pygame Screen Positions:
1. Centering -> center, centerx, centery
2. Edge -> top, bottom, left, right
3. Edge-Centering -> midbottom, midtop, midleft, midright, topleft, topright, bottomleft, bottomright.
